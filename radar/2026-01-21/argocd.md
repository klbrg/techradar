ArgoCD is a declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It's rapidly becoming the standard for Kubernetes deployments, enabling teams to use Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications.

ArgoCD automates deployment of desired application states in Kubernetes clusters, provides visibility into deployment status, and ensures environments stay in sync with Git. The UI is excellent for visualization, and it supports multiple sync strategies and deployment patterns.

While it's in TRIAL, many teams are successfully using ArgoCD in production. Learn ArgoCD if you're working with Kubernetes deployments and want to implement GitOps practices.
