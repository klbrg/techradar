Terraform is the leading Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool and a must-know for infrastructure engineers. Its declarative approach to infrastructure management, extensive provider ecosystem, and state management make it the de facto standard for multi-cloud infrastructure provisioning.

Terraform enables infrastructure teams to version control infrastructure, collaborate effectively, and maintain consistency across environments. The HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) is intuitive yet powerful, and the tool integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines.

Master Terraform modules, state management, workspace strategies, and best practices like remote state backends. Understanding Terraform is essential for modern infrastructure automation.
