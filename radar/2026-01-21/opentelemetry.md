OpenTelemetry is a vendor-neutral observability framework for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data (metrics, logs, traces). It's becoming the standard for observability in cloud-native applications.

OpenTelemetry unifies multiple observability signals into a single framework, reducing vendor lock-in and providing consistent instrumentation across languages and platforms. The CNCF project is rapidly maturing.

While still in ASSESS for many teams, OpenTelemetry is worth evaluating as it represents the future of observability. Understanding its concepts and architecture will be valuable as it moves toward wider adoption.
