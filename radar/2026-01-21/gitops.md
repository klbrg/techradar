GitOps is an operational framework that applies DevOps best practices (version control, collaboration, compliance, CI/CD) to infrastructure automation. Git serves as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications.

The GitOps approach provides auditability, rollback capabilities, and enhanced security through Git's access controls. It's particularly powerful with Kubernetes but applies to infrastructure generally.

Teams implementing GitOps report faster deployments, better disaster recovery, and improved collaboration. The methodology is maturing rapidly and becoming a standard practice for cloud-native infrastructure teams.
