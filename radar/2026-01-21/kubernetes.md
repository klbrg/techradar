Kubernetes is the industry standard for container orchestration and a core skill for modern infrastructure engineers. It provides automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across clusters of hosts.

For infrastructure engineers, Kubernetes proficiency is essential. It's the foundation for cloud-native architectures, enables declarative infrastructure management, and integrates with the entire cloud-native ecosystem (service meshes, observability, CI/CD).

Whether you're working with managed Kubernetes services (EKS, AKS, GKE) or self-managed clusters, understanding Kubernetes architecture, workload management, networking, and security is fundamental to modern infrastructure work.
