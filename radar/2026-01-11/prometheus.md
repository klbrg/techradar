Prometheus is the de facto standard for metrics and monitoring in cloud-native environments. As a CNCF graduated project, it's widely adopted for collecting and storing time-series data, with powerful querying via PromQL.

For infrastructure engineers, Prometheus is essential for monitoring Kubernetes clusters, applications, and infrastructure components. Its pull-based model, service discovery, and integration with Grafana make it ideal for dynamic environments.

Understanding Prometheus architecture, PromQL, alerting rules, and recording rules is crucial for building observable systems. It integrates seamlessly with the cloud-native ecosystem.
